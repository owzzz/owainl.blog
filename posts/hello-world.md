Hey, thanks for taking the time to check out my new personal site. This is the initial launch of what I hope will be a place to share interesting things I'm working on, a scratch-pad for ideas/musings and a place to store my creative endeavors.

## A little about me
I'm a Husband and Father to three girls. We are based in Austin Tx where I work as a Software Engineer at [Apple](https://apple.com). [I have been working in the tech industry for >15 years](https://www.linkedin.com/in/owainllewellyn) and have built digital products and services for a variety of luxury brands and government organizations. In my spare time [I enjoy cycling with friends](https://breakfastclubatx.com), making cocktails, [cooking outside](https://us.gozney.com) and working on projects that blend great design with engineering to solve real world problems.


## What's next?
In the coming weeks I will be working on building out the site and documenting the path as I go. The hope is it'll provide the opportunity to learn new things and enable me to share my findings.

This site is built on [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) and I've jumped in on the new [version 13](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs) release. At Apple I build tools in [EmberJS](https://emberjs.com)/[Symfony](https://symfony.com) and wanted an excuse to try a different stack. So far it's been easy to get up and running and I've been impressed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com) their build system and all the bells and whistles it provides.

Currently the site is using static markdown files to generate content which is great for some of the basic blogging functions but I'd like to start adding some more dynamic elements to the site and so I'll be adding a database, creating an authoring experience with passkey authentication and getting into some file storage APIs for storing imagery.

If you're interested you can follow along with my progress by visiting my github [release page](https://github.com/owzzz/owainl.blog/releases) or clicking on the version number at the bottom right of this site to see the latest release. I plan on adding a road map so that I can document and track progress.

Below are a few immediate tasks I'd like to explore.

- Sentry Logging, Github Version link - [Release v0.2.0](https://github.com/owzzz/owainl.blog/releases/tag/0.2.0)
- Tagging
- CMS Authoring (Currently generated via markdown files)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io/) (ORM)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) Database

But more on this in the coming weeks. Stay tuned.

Hey, thanks for stopping by. This is my very first and last post of 2022. It's been a crazy year for many reasons as I'm sure it has been for all of us. I hope to steadily increase my output in 2023 as I launch this site. I have no idea what will become of it but it feels like a good time to make the leap.

This is a new project and one that I've been thinking about for quite some time. It occurred to me over many years that I was navigating my career with no real online presence or place for downloading thoughts, ideas and general musings into. I've often kept notes and scribbles of half baked ideas but wanted an accessible space where I could explore ideas in the open. I've looked around and considered writing platforms like [medium](https://medium.com), [sub-stack](https://substack.com) or social channels for writing and distributing but I wanted something I could build from the ground up. Adapt. Teardown and try out, learning new skills as I go. Having the freedom to work on something at a moments notice and without major roadblocks.

This site represents a digital scratch pad for some of those ideas. A place to document thoughts around areas of interest (Technology, Environment, Lifestyle and perhaps some of my hobbies) and an opportunity to do some self reflection and go where curiosity takes me.

In the coming months I hope to add features here when time permits.  I'll also try to summarize and share some of those learnings as I go. But mainly it's a place where I can try something out, get feedback and keep moving forward. All feedback welcome.

**A little bit about the build:** The site is being developed from the ground up using NextJS [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) [version 13 (Beta)](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs). Getting everything setup to this point has been straight forward so far and I've been impressed with their docs and in particular their build system [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

If you're interested you'll be able to see progress by visiting my [Github release page](https://github.com/owzzz/owainl.blog/releases) or clicking on the version number at the bottom right of this site to see the latest release.

Features are being tracked via [Github issues](https://github.com/owzzz/owainl.blog/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

Thanks again and feel free to [reach out](mailto:owain@owainl.co?subject=Website%20enquiry) and connect.

Happy Holidays and I wish you a fulfilled and productive 2023.

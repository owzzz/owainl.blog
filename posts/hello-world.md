**Hey, thanks for stopping by:** This is a new project, one that I've been meaning to start for some time. This site represents a digital scratch pad for ideas. A place to document thoughts around areas of interest (Technology, Environment, Lifestyle and perhaps some of my hobbies) and an opportunity to do some self reflection and go where curiosity takes me.

I wanted something I could build from the ground up, try out, adapt and teardown. Having the ability to work on something at a moments notice and with little friction.

I hope to add features here when time permits. I'll also try to summarize and share some of those learnings as I go. But mainly it's a place where I can try something out, get feedback and keep moving forward. All feedback welcome.

**A little bit about the build:** The site is being developed from the ground up using NextJS [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) [version 13 (Beta)](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs). Getting everything setup to this point has been straight forward so far and I've been impressed with their docs and in particular their build system [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

If you're interested you'll be able to see progress by visiting my [Github release page](https://github.com/owzzz/owainl.blog/releases) or clicking on the version number at the bottom right of this site to see the latest release.

Features are being tracked via [Github issues](https://github.com/owzzz/owainl.blog/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

Thanks again and feel free to [reach out](mailto:owain@owainl.co?subject=Website%20enquiry) and connect.

## Intro
Hey, thanks for taking the time to check out my new personal site. This is day zero of what I hope will be a place to share interesting things I'm working on, a scratch-pad to work out ideas and general musings and a place to document and self-examen my life (for better or worse).

## A little about me
I'm a Husband and Father to three girls. We are based in Austin Tx where I work as a Software Engineer at [Apple](https://apple.com). [I have been working in the tech industry for >15 years](https://www.linkedin.com/in/owainllewellyn) and have built digital products and services for a variety of luxury brands and government organizations. In my spare time [I enjoy cycling with friends](https://breakfastclubatx.com), making cocktails, [cooking outside](https://us.gozney.com) and working on projects that blend great design with interesting engineering problems that solve real world problems.

In the coming weeks I will be working on building out the site and documenting the path as I go. Right now it's a bare bones [NextJs](https://nextjs.org) (V13) application but my plan is to roll out features on a weekly basis. Below are some of the immediate features I'd like to launch:

- Tags
- Authoring (Currently generated via markdown files)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io/) (ORM)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) Database

But more on this in the coming weeks. Stay tuned.

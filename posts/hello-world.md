**Hey, thanks for stopping by:** This is my new personal website, one that I've been meaning to start for some time. I hope it'll serve as a place for documenting ideas and experimenting on personal projects. A digital scratch pad that I can use to explore new tech and things that peak my interest.

The site will serve as a jump off point to experiment with software from scratch, trying out, adapting and tearing down whilst sharing what I've learnt along the way. This approach I hope will allow me to create at a moments notice and without friction.

**A little bit about the build:** The site is being developed from the ground up using NextJS [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) [version 13 (Beta)](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs). Getting everything setup to this point has been straight forward so far and I've been impressed with their docs and in particular their build system [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

I hope to add features here when time permits. I'll also try to summarize and share some of those learnings as I go. Mainly it'll be a place where I can try stuff out, get feedback and keep momentum. 

If you're interested you'll be able to see progress by visiting my [Github release page](https://github.com/owzzz/owainl.blog/releases) or clicking on the version number at the bottom right of this site to see the latest release.

Features are being tracked via [Github issues](https://github.com/owzzz/owainl.blog/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

All feedback welcome and feel free to [reach out](mailto:owain@owainl.co?subject=Website%20enquiry) and connect.

I'm excited to get started.

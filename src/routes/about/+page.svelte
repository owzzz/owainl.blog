        <div class="content">
          <p>Originally from Wales in the UK, I have been living and working in the states for nearly 10 years, raising two young girls with my <a href="https://www.selostudios.com" target="_blank">wife</a> in Austin, Texas. I am currently building internal tools at Apple, working as a full-stack UI/UX engineer.</p>
          
          <p>I am a collaborative and motivated self-starter, proactive in solving technical problems, operating in fast-paced and dynamic environments with experience in building high-quality enterprise software at scale. I have worked with a variety of luxury brands, tech companies, and government organizations across Europe and North America.</p>
          
          <p>In my spare time I enjoy tinkering with technology, reading books, hanging out with family and friends, cycling and cooking outside.</p>

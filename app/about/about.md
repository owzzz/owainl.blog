Hey, thanks for taking the time to check out my site. 

**A little about me:** I'm a Husband and Father to three girls. Originally from Wales in the UK, and now based in Austin Tx where I work as a Software Engineer at [Apple](https://apple.com). [I have been working in the tech industry for >15 years](https://www.linkedin.com/in/owainllewellyn) across Europe and North America. I have worked on teams building digital products and services for a variety of luxury brands, tech companies and government organizations. In my spare time [I enjoy cycling with friends](https://breakfastclubatx.com), making cocktails, [cooking outside](https://us.gozney.com) and working on projects that blend great design with engineering to solve interesting real world problems.

## Why?
This site is the launch of what I hope will be a place to share interesting things I'm musing on, a scratch-pad for ideas and a place to explore creative projects.

## What's next?
In the future I will be working on building out the site and documenting areas that I find interesting or challenging in the hope it'll provide the opportunity to learn new things and enable me to share my experience.

This site is built on [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) and I've jumped in on the new [version 13](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs) release with no prior working experience of NextJS. At Apple I build tools in [EmberJS](https://emberjs.com)/[Symfony](https://symfony.com) and wanted an excuse to try a different stack and to test myself. So far it's been relatively straight forward to get up and running and I've been particularly impressed with [Vercel.](https://vercel.com) NextJs's build system with it's zero configuration and automated pipeline setup.

Currently the site is using static markdown files to generate content which is great for some of the basic blogging functions but I'd like to start adding some more dynamic elements to the site and build it out organically.

If you're interested you can follow along with my progress by visiting my github [release page](https://github.com/owzzz/owainl.blog/releases) or clicking on the version number at the bottom right of this site to see the latest release. I plan on adding a road map so that I can document and track progress.

To see some of the features I'm tracking you can visit my [tracked issues](https://github.com/owzzz/owainl.blog/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

Thanks again for stopping by and feel free to [reach out](mailto:owain@owainl.co?subject=Website%20enquiry) if you'd like to connect.

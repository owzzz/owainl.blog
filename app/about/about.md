[I have been working in the tech industry for >15 years](https://www.linkedin.com/in/owainllewellyn) across Europe and North America working on digital products and services for a variety of luxury brands, tech companies and government organizations. Today I work at [Apple](https://apple.com) designing and building internal tools.

Originally from Wales in the UK, I have been in the states for nearly 10 years, raising two young girls with my [wife](https://www.selostudios.com/about).

In my spare time I enjoy hanging out with the family, [cycling with friends](https://breakfastclubatx.com), making cocktails, [cooking outside](https://us.gozney.com) and working on projects that incorporate great design with engineering to solve interesting problems.

## What is this?
I'm building this site as a place to store and share thoughts on topics I'm exploring, a scratch-pad for ideas and a place to explore creative projects. In the future I plan to build out the site and document the details I find interesting and that have been challenging in the hope it may provide value for others.

At Apple I build tools in [EmberJS](https://emberjs.com)/[Symfony](https://symfony.com) and wanted an excuse to try a different stack and so I've opted for [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) [version 13 (Beta)](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs) for this site. Getting things setup has been straight forward and I've been impressed with their docs and in particular their build system [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

If you're interested you can see progress by visiting my [Github release page](https://github.com/owzzz/owainl.blog/releases) or clicking on the version number at the bottom right of this site to see the latest release.

Features are being tracked via [Github issues](https://github.com/owzzz/owainl.blog/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

Thanks again for stopping by and feel free to [reach out](mailto:owain@owainl.co?subject=Website%20enquiry) if you'd like to connect.
